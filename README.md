## Current Work

In my PhD research, I'm researching computer vision security by trying to answer the question "Can we make secure computer vision systems?". And by *secure*, I mean robust, trustworthy, explainable, and maybe even provable. My long-term goal is to use the technical skills I'm learning through my computer vision security research, and apply it in the space domain.
